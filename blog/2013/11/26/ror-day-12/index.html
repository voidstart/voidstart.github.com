<h1>&ldquo;Retrospective&rdquo;</h1>

<p>In retrospect, there are several things that are quite fresh to me.</p>

<ul>
<li>MVC thinking</li>
<li>Template transformation ( erb &ndash;> html, js &hellip; )</li>
<li>Ruby block</li>
<li>Pervasive conventions over configuration</li>
<li>Request and State</li>
</ul>


<p>MVC makes the parts of the app easily separated, easy to find what
goes where and reason about.</p>

<p>Transformations from embedded ruby
to other sources are the bridge to generate web pages according to
states, including db and user interactions.</p>

<p>Ruby block shows first order functions, and provides a new way of
thinking about code and behavior. We can pass behaviors around and attach
to another behavior or data.</p>

<p>Conventions make a lot things easier. A lot of hard questions are not
about figuring out how to do, but just choose something, like naming
things and putting things somewhere. Conventions make those no brainers.</p>

<p>Request and state is particular for web development. The server and client
communicates by requests one at a time. To pass on the conversation across
requests, state must be maintained.</p>
