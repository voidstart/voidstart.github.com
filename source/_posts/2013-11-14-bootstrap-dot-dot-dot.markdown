Hello, this post marks the beginning of my shifting
to web development. 

The making of this blog has been part of my efforts 
to become an indie developer. I am kind of idealistic
enough to believe in [remote work](http://37signals.com/remote/).

For web development, [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is of particular 
interest. It's neat.  The community is extremely 
active and vibrant. I guess I'll start from here, 
see how it goes.
