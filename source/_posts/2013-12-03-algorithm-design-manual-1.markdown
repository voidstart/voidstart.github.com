Today I started review algorithms with [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://amzn.com/0387948600?tag=a200-20),
recommended by [Coding for interviews](http://codingforinterviews.com/books).

Not going to follow the step-by-step _"enjoy the show"_ approach as [the agile Rails book](http://pragprog.com/book/rails32/agile-web-development-with-rails-3-2).
I'll start with selected chapters/sections, and go to basics when in doubt. 

Currently I have several things for starter:

- Sorting
- Data structures of array/list/dict/queue 
- Logorithms in Complexity Analysis
