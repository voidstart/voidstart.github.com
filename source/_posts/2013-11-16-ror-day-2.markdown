Separation of Concerns

Model, View, Controller is a good way for humans
to understand computer codes, at least some kinds
of them.

The particular senario this methodology addresses
is a stateful, interactive, perspective application.

There are many kinds of codes. It's hard to model
something like a device driver with MVC.

"GUI + storage + business-logic" is a very common
case, especially a website.

This convention forces the way of thinking, and makes
it easier to reason. In essense, MVC itself is a
design decision.
