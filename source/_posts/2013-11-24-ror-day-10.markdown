"Internationalization"
=
Essentially, every string is a fixed value that is
like enum. However, since texts are so easy to just
type out, people tend to just write them out, rather
than defining any enumeration.

Eventually the solution is to use something like tagging,
which is some function to return a translated version
based on locale.

This is kind of a unique case where a certain special
string literal markings can be useful. In C++ world, there's
a proposal for 2014 which adds physics units to the string
literal, enabling interpretations of physics units at the
compiler level. That could be a great inspiration for i18n.
