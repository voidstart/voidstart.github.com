"Templates as methods"
=
It's a great idea, actually, more of a general idea.

Templates for web code are like methods that can be
reused, parameterized. This analogy can be extended
to many things, and I believe great things will come
out of it. Think of pictures as methods, videos as
methods. Designs, colors, quotes, that can have _API_,
can be auto-suggusted or auto-completed, with detailed
parameters. This can be fun.
