Progress
=
- More ruby syntax (require,||, bang method, prediate method)
- Depot app (pencil and paper design, db migrate/seed, sass, validation)
- page 100/476

"Scaffold"
=
This is not a new idea. MS word has "template" documents.
Things are given to solve a particular problem, with minimal defaults, which
can be viewed as "conventions".

Common tasks like add a controller, add a table, a field, where to put stylesheets,
where to put validation, where to put tests... All have a "conventional" answer.

Developers' needs are addressed to be easy to get started. Brilliant.
