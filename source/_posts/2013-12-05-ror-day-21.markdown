Quite accidently, it's been 21 days and I finished first reading of the Agile Rails book.
Learn Rails in 21 days.. Well, not quite.

It's usable and refreshing in many aspects, but far from masterery. If this were bicycle,
I'd be just able to make one meter without putting foot on the ground. You know the
skills are just that many, but need more excercise to burn into the brain.

So far I can remeber to do scaffold generation and db:migrate, sometimes just not sure
when to use `rails` when to use `rake`. To add a new column, a new migration ( some kind of
script ) has to be written and run and tracked. In `def change`, the syntax for new column
is not obvious to the mind, had to look it up.

The devil's in the details. The plan is bascially correct.
