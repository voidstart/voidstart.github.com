It's amazing that people invent one language just to write
another language easier.

The simplest form is Macro languages, those just do short hand
substitutions. Advanced forms would invent its own simpler,
idomatic syntax, to map one structure to another. The advantages
they provide are usually: expressiveness (say more with less),
intuitive (fits people's mind).

Thinking about RoR in general and anything that tries to make
people express more easily, the general idea is the same. You
capture people's intuition, reduce repititions.

I think of RoR as providing a form, just like one of those you fill 
at the immigration office. So that you don't have to do your own
composition writing. This is convenient, and enforces a certain level
of quality. The downside is it cuts into your imagination space.

The good thing is you get started and have an idea, then starting to
erase the form and draw your own image. :D
