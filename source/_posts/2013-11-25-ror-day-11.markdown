There seems to be always a need to make the testing
environment as simple as possible, for the benefit of quick looping
in experimentation. For real world, however, the priority has changed.
The performance becomes first order, and changes are slow.

The root reason being stability and speed. For any product, it is important to maintain the balance
between delivering a stable, dependenable expectations, and the need
for new functions.

Take it further, it's the difference of existing function and wanted function that matter. If the
need for new/better function outweighs the stability of existing ones, things need to go faster.

In Linux, there's the rule of never break the user's code, respect total backwards compatibility.
Only after years of obsoletion a supported feature could be deleted. Even so, such old products
could still go the history museums.

In today's fast-food world, it becomes rarity to be something that lasts decades. Standing the
test of time is such a beautiful property in modern times.
