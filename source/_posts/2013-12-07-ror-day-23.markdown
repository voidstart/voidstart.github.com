The correct way to handle `ForbiddenAttribute` issue : [Put in controller](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17371334/how-is-attr-accessible-used-in-rails-4). Actually Rails 4 already
automatically generate code which is a private method to `permit` the paramters of assignment.

After setting the `permit` method, things are working now.
``` ruby Generated code
private
# Use callbacks to share common setup or constraints between actions.
def set_product
  @product = Product.find(params[:id])
end

# Never trust parameters from the scary internet, only allow the white list through.
def product_params
  params[:product].permit(:price,:imgurl)
end
```
Next I modified the view of the products index a bit with a bit of plain HTML table. It's not "fancy" as Depot, but functional enough for me. 

Then I want the home page to show the products index, modified the route and
it's a small change. At least now I know where to look for the changes when I want to do something.
The comments in those generated files are helpful.

Now I'd like the _sidebar_, which I know got to do with _layout_. Then I faced the problem of writing
css, which I basically still knows nothing about. Refer to the scss of Depot, I found out about the
`float` attribute, which probably makes the left/right split to panes.

There's a great [article](http://www.jaceju.net/blog/archives/18/) on this.
