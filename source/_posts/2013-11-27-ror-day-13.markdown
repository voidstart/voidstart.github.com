"Ajax, Javascript, Css"
=
This is not something much about Ruby or Rails, just web dev
in general.

Ajax allows interaction without page reload. A request still happens
in the background, but only partical page is obtained. DOM tree largely
remains the same, but part of the tree got replaced.

Javascript is the language used to manipulate the DOM tree, and such
code sources need to be adaptive to content, too. Thus, we could again
use Ruby to generate JS code from templates, just like html pages.
We ends up with: use ruby to do js, use js to do html, use html to do page.
Just an amazing stack.

Css is the language to do styling via several things:
- Identify some elements in the DOM (via class, id)
- Describe the style of that element (font,color,size,margin..)
