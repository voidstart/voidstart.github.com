Whitelist vs blacklist
=
It's clever as a security design to disable everything first, then
only when needed, add whitelistings for things that do need direct
access without authentication.

I first thought the authentication should be put in the models, because
no matter how the top structure may be complex to control, the gatekeeper
should be at the last defence for the database.

Turns out I was wrong. In Rails, the super class of all controller could
be used as the central location of access before all other smaller logic
units.

I am still not sure an _admin page_ to "welcome" is really needed as the
books says. I am just looking to guard existing functionality with user
authentication.
