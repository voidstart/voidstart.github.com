"Production"

Prototype and production are different. The gap may seem complex
but it really shouldn't be. The stuff makes a good prototype should
have good benefits on the production-type also. But then comes the
question of why the gap.

I've talked about [Production Qualified](http://voidstart.com/blog/2013/11/25/ror-day-11/) before,
about the differences in existence. Now I wonder why one system cannot take the upsides of both.

There really is no reason that a prototype shouldn't be stable and performant. The real problem
is simplicity. Production systems are complex, especially for large scale. It takes extra logic
to optimize/enhance for different situations, such as millions of concurrent users or bad 3G network.
Security risks are high, storage loads are high and data is much more important that can never be
lost. Logging is going to handle both the load and safisticated enough for deep analysis, even
for graphing and data mining purposes.

Why cannot all these be some kind of plugins that could be easily enabled by installation with
a package manager. If the structure is well thought of to enable such reliable extension, there
really should be no reason of why it can't be done.
