"First class function"

Block of codes can be passed to functions as values.
This is a powerful feature of the Ruby language.
The "yield" call is interesting.  For-loops can be
much different and this solves a lot of abstraction
issue with things like the "visitor pattern".

Active Records solves another issue with repetative 
duplication logic with class objects and database
tables. They are very simular things in a way, but
are much different to access. Active Records is a
device for adapting the differences of access.
