"Functional Tests"
=
Running tests is like have some robot always
watching your back, which is nice.

The tests written for this demo project follow
such a pattern: add a feature first, then write
a test to ensure _some_ of its behavior.

So far it's hard to imagine the way of writing
tests first, because what to test is yet to be
known.
