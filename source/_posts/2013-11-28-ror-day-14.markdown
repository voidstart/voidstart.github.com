"Playtime"

Following the book to write the app is straightforward, since everything
is detailed explained. 

Playtime is the section without the answers explained, but only the questions given.
I had struggled with some of the questions for quite some time.

So far I have done all the playtime by myself and many of the errors I made are
caused by misunderstanding and carelessness. Through Googling and re-examining
the source codes, eventually the issue will settle.

The hard part about development is sometimes the error message just does not make
sense, you have to apply intuition, play and compare and ask good questions. This
is ultimately about the gap between computer and human, imagine if computer can
figure out all the underlying issues of why something does not work and print
the exact issue right in front of you. Everything is just like cooking recipe, even the error
printed, designed by human. The logic paths are thought first by a human, then coded
into recipes for the execution loop.

Perhaps I should look at machine learning courses for some inspirations.
