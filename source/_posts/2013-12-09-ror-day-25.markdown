Towards understandng of the routes
=

Let me layout the gist of routing:

User browser side:
	Request: HTTP_METHOD + URL
	HTTP_METHOD: One  of GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
	URL: Something like /products/17

Server side:
	Needs to decide: Controller, Action, and Params

Example:  /products/17
	"products" :-> Controller
	"17" :-> :id (of  Params)
	Now what's the _Action_ ? (Method to call)
	Answer: Depends on _HTTP_METHOD_ , which is not part of URL, but part of
		the underlying communication from browser. ex. GET -> Show (Quite obvious)


Helpers:
	In Rails code, both URL and HTTP_METHOD for the generated link can be constructed
	in some kind of wrapper method like `product_path(1)`. This is part of Rails evolution [history](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1548009/rails-link-to-routes-and-nested-resources).

What's troubling me is it's fair enough to understand the explict way of just write out the URL,
but sometimes confusing to figure out what exactly some helper would generate.
