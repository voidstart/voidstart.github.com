"Ultimate communication: Email"
=

I remember somebody said that having emails is the final
stage of advancement of any program. The example being used
was Emacs. Any application complicated enough should at one
time thinking about supporting emails.

It's amazing that such an old technology still lives at the
edge of our modern lives. Nothing much about emails have
changed over time. Emails are truly classic, and truly a
basic component of our lives, like beds and wheels. Something
never dies.
