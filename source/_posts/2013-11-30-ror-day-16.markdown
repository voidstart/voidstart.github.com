"DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself"
=

In a sense, the database table/row/column has much resonance with
the OO's class/object/attribute. The dimensions are very similiar.

This is repitition to the humans.However, to the machines and the different
systems, it's more like saying more or less the same thing in two
langauges. Translation is in order. But since this is defined so
formally in computer languages, can't that be easily translated by
machines themselves?

Well, Active Record is all about the automatic translations. There
are rules about names translation, and operations translations, defined
by humans. Once the rules are in place, the human repetitions can stop.
Naming things is hard, except when you can fixiate on some convention
predefined. Everybody just have to agree on the conventions.

We are like dealing with very intricate stuff in a small kingdom of computer
models and objects and databases and what have you. We can't keep
debating about the names of common things like streets and roads. That
has to be fixed to let us communicate effectively, so we can navigate
without losing the way.

Rails is such fixation. We express one thing, Rails knows the other.
There are exceptions when we want to keep things _irregular_, Rails allows
that can let us put our exceptions in the system.
