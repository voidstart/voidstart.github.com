  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Towards understandng of the routes</h1>

<p>Let me layout the gist of routing:</p>

<p>User browser side:</p>

<pre><code>Request: HTTP_METHOD + URL
HTTP_METHOD: One  of GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
URL: Something like /products/17
</code></pre>

<p>Server side:</p>

<pre><code>Needs to decide: Controller, Action, and Params
</code></pre>

<p>Example:  /products/17</p>

<pre><code>"products" :-&gt; Controller
"17" :-&gt; :id (of  Params)
Now what's the _Action_ ? (Method to call)
Answer: Depends on _HTTP_METHOD_ , which is not part of URL, but part of
    the underlying communication from browser. ex. GET -&gt; Show (Quite obvious)
</code></pre>

<p>Helpers:</p>

<pre><code>In Rails code, both URL and HTTP_METHOD for the generated link can be constructed
in some kind of wrapper method like `product_path(1)`. This is part of Rails evolution [history](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1548009/rails-link-to-routes-and-nested-resources).
</code></pre>

<p>What&rsquo;s troubling me is it&rsquo;s fair enough to understand the explict way of just write out the URL,
but sometimes confusing to figure out what exactly some helper would generate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Turns out the <em>view</em> alone is a totally new world. I guess this is
what they call a <em>front end</em> ? CSS is a language more or less similar
to XML, which is structured, nested, element/attribute oriented language.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s declarative. This makes a difference. Programming in declarative needs
an understanding of the <em>engine</em> that&rsquo;s behind the interpretation of such
rules. However, I don&rsquo;t have to step-by-step simulate a running program.
All I have to do, is just start with a blank paper, and <em>add</em> the <em>effects</em>
of those elements and attributes under the rules. The good thing about this
kind of system is it&rsquo;s constructed by superposition, like linear systems.
While imperative programming is more about states and transition in time,
the reasoning is harder and more delicate.</p>

<p>Learning CSS elements and properties certainly take time. However,
to have some sense of design and imagine a <em>target</em> to draw is a skill
of another level. Perhaps I should just be satisfied at the moment
for some basic tricks like positions, fonts, and just dividing the page
into some blocks of areas.</p>

automatically generate code which is a private method to <code>permit</code> the paramters of assignment.</p>

<p>After setting the <code>permit</code> method, things are working now.</p>

<p>Next I modified the view of the products index a bit with a bit of plain HTML table. It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; as Depot, but functional enough for me.</p>

<p>Then I want the home page to show the products index, modified the route and
it&rsquo;s a small change. At least now I know where to look for the changes when I want to do something.
The comments in those generated files are helpful.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;d like the <em>sidebar</em>, which I know got to do with <em>layout</em>. Then I faced the problem of writing
css, which I basically still knows nothing about. Refer to the scss of Depot, I found out about the
<code>float</code> attribute, which probably makes the left/right split to panes.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been observing Bitcoin and read about it for some time now.
I think I&rsquo;ll just give it some of my opinions.</p>

<p>Recently Bitcoin has risen from a niche toy ( when you could buy a pizza for 10,000 BTC ), to
the all time high of over 1000 USD per BTC. It entered pubic sight and caught the attention of
governments. There are many stories to tell, let me just layout the ones I think are significant
and worth some thinking:</p>

<ul>
<li>some consider BTC one of <a href="http://www.garynorth.com/public/11828.cfm">Ponzi scheme</a></li>
<li>there are BTC-backed organized crimial black market for drugs, guns etc.</li>
<li>BTC are used for cross-border money transfer with low transaction fees</li>
<li>BTC are used as marketing stunts ( some real estate even sold for BTC )</li>
<li>BTC has their own exchanges like a stock market</li>
<li>BTC are said to have risk of being used for money laundering</li>
<li>BTC heists. Virtually impossible to trace.</li>
<li>there is a whole small industry to <em>print</em> the money of BTC (mining hardware,software)</li>
<li>Finally, BTC are considered currency of the future</li>
</ul>


<p>Just 2 days ago, the central bank of China issued some <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/publish/goutongjiaoliu/524/2013/20131205153156832222251/20131205153156832222251_.html">notice</a> ( essentically government policies ) to
ban the use of BTC by any banks or financial instituations, or any commercial payments.
The price of BTC dropped significantly following the news.</p>

<p>My opinions can be expressed by my predictions of the future of Bitcoin:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin ( or its variant ) <em>will</em> survive, because it&rsquo;s a credit system that offers unique features:
anonymity. It&rsquo;s perfect for criminal activities and other secret merchant activities. For this single
reason, it can survive for as long as there&rsquo;s a demand for such a credit system. Sad, but unavoidable.</li>
<li>For BTC to have <em>value</em>, it has to be backed by <em>real money</em> that are exchangable to general society
economic merchandises. Currently it has been the BTC exchanges, which are filled with speculators.
What <em>I predict will</em> appear is something like a BTC bank, that an organization will <em>offcially back</em> the BTC similar to the repayability of dollar ( once in history USD are exchangable to gold ). Such bank, whether above ground or underground, will show up simply because it&rsquo;s profitable and sustainable from collecting transaction fees. Imagine such <em>bank</em> gurentees 1 USD to 1 BTC repayment at any time, if such bank can be trusted enough, BTC essentically become USD with added property of anomymity. By BTC&rsquo;s current limit of 21 million, this will be 21 million of this speical kind of USD.</li>
<li>Speculators could keep the price of BTC at high level, if they allow their money to be freezed in the form of BTC. However, the game will eventually become in equilibrium, the number of speculators and
speculator money will cease to increase, and some people inevitably would like to withdraw their money to do something else. The over-evaluation period will end, the price will drop to a level that is
suitable to the demand of the said above use: demand for anonymous money for dark activities.</li>
</ul>


<p>I could even provide a wild guess for the lower bound of BTC price. Since the dark market&rsquo;s global
scale is at least in the billions USD range. Let&rsquo;s give an absurd value of 1 Billion usage of BTC
as the means of trade. 1,000,000,000 / 21,000,000 = 47.6 USD.</p>

<p>Conclusion: BTC under 47.6$ will be a buy.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Don&rsquo;t take this seriously. Pure speculation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I spent some time watching an hour-long <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8&amp;feature=share">video</a> about <em>Functional Programming</em>.</p>

<p>It made two significant points that struck me:</p>

<ul>
<li>types are just mathematical sets</li>
<li>functions can be thought just like mathematical functions mapping set A to set B ( input type and return type )</li>
</ul>


<p>When thinking like this, I all of sudden get a hint of what a <em>type system</em> actually
might be like. Although this talk is primarily to layout the work for <em>monads</em>, it
really helps understanding programming from a different perspective than imperative.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about one input and one output, but multiple input can be tricked to use <em>currying</em>
to simulate ( or compose ). That has a lot of potential in reasoning about programs.</p>

<p>Other aspects regarding philosophy also are quite remarkable:</p>

<ul>
<li>The word <em>simple</em> is ambiguous. It can be &ldquo;more explict, more obvious&rdquo; by some, but
&ldquo;more implict, more abstract&rdquo; by others. The word <em>small</em> however, always implies <em>simple</em> but without
the controversy.</li>
<li><em>Composability</em> is <em>the</em> way to manage complexcity, or build one. This makes sense.
Random stiched up things are scary and unmaintable. In his words, we spent to much time not
productive, but just stiching tings up.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Learning without understanding doesn&rsquo;t last in memory. Just I tried to
do something simple as add a few columns and update their values on my own.
I got into the error of &ldquo;Forbidden attributes&rdquo;. It appears to be related
to <a href="http://blog.xdite.net/posts/2012/03/05/github-hacked-rails-security/">mass assignment problem</a>.</p>

<p>The thing with understanding such a problem, is that the level of abstraction
is a bit high. To think <em>natively</em> on this, what exactly doesn&rsquo;t work?</p>

<p>A http request doesn&rsquo;t trigger what it suppose to do, instead it returns a page generated
by Rails displaying the <em>error trace</em>. To a stranger with reasonable intelligence, this is like
non-sense. Leave me with either <em>Google it</em> or search for a clue in my mind. If I then
start to read the source codes of the trace, it will be overwhelming information, which 99% I don&rsquo;t
care for the problem at hand. My mind has some vague clue that this probably has something to do
with <em>Edit</em> &ldquo;action&rdquo; of &ldquo;product&rdquo; ActiveRecord, which involves model,database,controller, if more
unlikely web server request/response, or other parts of Rails.</p>

<p>Google is a helpful friend here, directing me to suspect the &ldquo;mass assignment&rdquo; problem that once
in history got Github hacked. It has been a while, so modern Rails probably adapted and make
security <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/mass-assignment-rails-and-you/">precautions</a> that by default bans certain <code>update</code> function, causing this error.
One of the link suggusts DHH has some Gist to <a href="https://gist.github.com/dhh/1975644">demo</a> a way of resolution.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still making sense of all this. In the meantime, I continue to play with building the small
book store app.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quite accidently, it&rsquo;s been 21 days and I finished first reading of the Agile Rails book.
Learn Rails in 21 days.. Well, not quite.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s usable and refreshing in many aspects, but far from masterery. If this were bicycle,
I&rsquo;d be just able to make one meter without putting foot on the ground. You know the
skills are just that many, but need more excercise to burn into the brain.</p>

<p>So far I can remeber to do scaffold generation and db:migrate, sometimes just not sure
when to use <code>rails</code> when to use <code>rake</code>. To add a new column, a new migration ( some kind of
script ) has to be written and run and tracked. In <code>def change</code>, the syntax for new column
is not obvious to the mind, had to look it up.</p>

<p>The devil&rsquo;s in the details. The plan is bascially correct.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought I&rsquo;d just start to warm up myself by writing some sorting
algorithm.</p>

<p>At first, I thought to first write some random generator for testing usage. Then
I realized that&rsquo;s not the goal, to compare each algo with different types of inputs.
I am just trying to implement <em>correct</em> sorting. The performance, code compactness,
caching all are not my concerns. So the result is hardcoded <em>random</em> input, and I
will print the whole array after each <em>pass</em> or interation (after swap etc), to
observe the <em>sorting process</em> and final sorted array.</p>

<p>I did from scatch the bubble, insertion, selection and merge sort. Turns out it&rsquo;s
not easy to get right the first try even for such simple algorithm. My errors mostly
on index off by 1, edge cases. Time spent mostly on thinking the <em>sorted</em> vs the <em>unsorted</em> part,
and their transition. Direction, index, temps are most concerned.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good excercise.</p>

<p>I review some other things besides this:</p>

<ul>
<li>the spiral rule of c++ declaraions</li>
<li>c++ quiz quesions (includes some c++ 11 stuff)</li>
<li>stack and queues</li>

a single char. It&rsquo;s mathematically obvious that encodings like this save
more space/typing.</p>

<p>Just like in algebra, complex variables are represented by just a Greek letter.
It makes writing, reading, reasoning all the easier.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s for humans, the hands and the brains.</p>

<h1>&ldquo;Funny names&rdquo;</h1>

<p>Cucumber, Rspec, webrat.. It&rsquo;s definitely just 0s and 1s and nothing special.
I think the <em>branding</em> is to create identity, to advertise, to make an impression,
to humans, ultimately.</p>

<p>Serves similar to <em>syntax compression</em>, it taps to how human brain works, related
to cognative science, neuro science and phycology. One of the ways for gamblers to
remember cards is to associate each card with a unique object like a flag, a tree etc.
It&rsquo;s the common memorization techniques.</p>

<p>We could go futher to create deeper associations. One example is, to remember several
random objects, one imagine a room he&rsquo;s in and <em>put</em> the random things to certain
locations in the room, as one <em>virtually</em> walking inside it. This creates connections
to things with one&rsquo;s sense of space ( room places ) and time ( walking ).</p>

<p>Maybe next time I&rsquo;ll name some Gem this way, when I write my own gems.</p>

<h1>&ldquo;Voila&rdquo;</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s the end of first time reading this book. A lot is learned, a lot is made sense of,
still a lot is missing the connection.</p>

<p>Next up, I&rsquo;ll try to redo the app on my own, <em>without</em> following the steps, to refresh the
memory and understanding.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I started review algorithms with <a href="http://amzn.com/0387948600?tag=a200-20">The Algorithm Design Manual</a>,
recommended by <a href="http://codingforinterviews.com/books">Coding for interviews</a>.</p>

<p>Not going to follow the step-by-step <em>&ldquo;enjoy the show&rdquo;</em> approach as <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/rails32/agile-web-development-with-rails-3-2">the agile Rails book</a>.
I&rsquo;ll start with selected chapters/sections, and go to basics when in doubt.</p>

<p>Currently I have several things for starter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sorting</li>
<li>Data structures of array/list/dict/queue</li>
<li>Logorithms in Complexity Analysis</li>
</ul>
