  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Persistance</h1>

<p>When writing the Depot clone, I didn&rsquo;t give much thought on
whether a thing is backed by database or not. Turns out this
is very important.</p>

<p>I am working on the checkout after I did the login. Thought
it should be easy. But then I didn&rsquo;t start by creating an order
scaffold, rather, I thought the cart would do much of the work.
Since I could just print the cart out for the checkout page, and
do some fake payment option in the view just to get started for
later, when I would really look into creating the payment receiving
part.</p>

<p>Well, I was wrong. The order controller is very much needed, since although
the cart has the &ldquo;billing list&rdquo; of items, they don&rsquo;t <em>persist</em>.
Carts are attached to sessions, and could be gone after timeout.
Once going to the payment, they should be inside the database
to be persisted. At first I thought maybe I can refernce the cart_id, ha,
nope. The cart doesn&rsquo;t persist, so the cart_id doesn&rsquo;t make sense.
So I should just copy the cart&rsquo;s contents over, duplicate in the order,
and then save it? Seems extra work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll take a look back into the book&rsquo;s approach.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Human Interface</h1>

<p>Mouse has been around for about 30 to 40 years.
Keyboards are even older than that, since the ages of typewriter, before computers.
Still, they are the most common human interface around today.</p>

<p>Touch screen has come along, but pretty much only used on smaller screens like phones.
Most recently, there&rsquo;s been some utilization of body language due to advancement of
sensors and computer vision.  That&rsquo;s about it about human interface.</p>

<p>I love the keyboard much, primarily because of it&rsquo;s faster than mouse in many cases.
The most important reason is that, pressing a keyboard shortcut needs less finger movement,
and only cost about 0.1 to 0.2 seconds. Plus, keyboard has a large vocabulary, many commands
can be issued from keyboard. Contract to mouse, which has 2 to 5 keys and pointer device.</p>

<p>Mouse is great at selecting things, much more accurate and intuitive. So occationally, or
when commands are not at hand, mouse is better.</p>

<h1>My setup with keyboard</h1>

<ul>
<li>Blackwidow mechanical keyboard</li>
<li>Macros using Synapse 2.0 to activate common apps. No more <code>cmd + tab</code>, one key to one app.
For this, I map F15 to F19 to Firefox, Sublime, Chrome, iTerm and Preview for pdf reading.</li>
<li>Use <code>slate</code> app to do window management, so I can maximize, left-half, right-half the screen
with just one key.</li>
<li>Use <code>Alfred</code> to launch less often used apps.</li>
<li>Use Vim, Sublime, iTerm, and be familiar with the common shortcuts.</li>
<li>In Firefox, use vimperator; in Chrome, use Vimium.</li>
<li>Disable Capslock, use KeyboardHackForMac to make it a <code>control</code> when pressed long, a <code>ESC</code> when pressed short time.</li>
<li><code>ESC</code> is mapped to a window layout</li>
<li>left/right shift mapped to <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> when pressed short.</li>
<li>Left <code>control</code> mapped to a <em>super meta</em>, which is <code>ctrl+shift+cmd+option</code></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Whitelist vs blacklist</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s clever as a security design to disable everything first, then
only when needed, add whitelistings for things that do need direct
access without authentication.</p>

<p>I first thought the authentication should be put in the models, because
no matter how the top structure may be complex to control, the gatekeeper
should be at the last defence for the database.</p>

<p>Turns out I was wrong. In Rails, the super class of all controller could
be used as the central location of access before all other smaller logic
units.</p>

<p>I am still not sure an <em>admin page</em> to &ldquo;welcome&rdquo; is really needed as the
books says. I am just looking to guard existing functionality with user
authentication.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>New numbering</h1>

<p>Yesterday I took a day off, so I guess the day counting could stop.
But I still decided to keep the article count. Now 27th of the Ruby on Rails series.</p>

<h1>Workflow</h1>

<p>I continue to build the Depot clone on my own, but I realize that going from 100%
on the book to 0% is too hard, making me get lost too often too quickly.
Sometimes not even sure what to search for on Google.
So I went back to the book for pointers and ideas, and then go implement without
typing against the book&rsquo;s code as I did for the first read.</p>

<p>With such workflow, my code works most of the time, but occationally I still need
the book to get on track. This time at least I have a feeling of where to write
stuff for which things, at the back of my head. That&rsquo;s a good thing.
I guess it&rsquo;s just normal to get confusion from a such a <em>magical</em> framework like Rails.</p>

<h1>Migration</h1>

<p>My db migrations often went incomplete the first try. I had to do multiple migrations
to get and understand what in the book was just one whole migration.</p>

<h1>Styling</h1>

<p>I skipped much of the not-so-fancy css styling from the book, but start with overly simplistic
styling <em>which I understand</em>. Then, improve with effects as I find the look more unsatifying.
This has been a good process to learn css/scss, as I can observe each effect immediately and
separately.</p>

<h1>JQuery</h1>

<p>The book appears to be a little out of date, since the gem of jquery has moved the jquery-ui part
out to be another standalone gem called <code>jquery-ui-rails</code>, no longer part of <code>jquery-rails</code>.</p>

<p>With jquery, I am having some difficulty in getting the css highlighting effect to work. Ajax-ly adding
items to cart works, but not with the css animation effect. When I tried to enable the css animate
code, it even broke the already working ajax-ly update of cart.</p>

<p>update: I just compared with the working app that I did from the book. Turns out it&rsquo;s syntax error
but it never caught my eye for like half an hour. What&rsquo;s worse, there&rsquo;s no error message.
Guess moments like this is when I should start hating dynamic languages without proper type checking?</p>

<p>Wrong code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>The wrong code</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p> This code looks easy to understand. But from recollection, I couldn&rsquo;t have written this out,
 because of lacking understanding of <code>build</code> method. There&rsquo;s obviously an SO <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11553824/what-exactly-is-this-rails-3-build-method-doing">question</a> regarding exactly what I
 want to ask.</p>

<p> The subtlety is that, behind the <code>build</code>, it&rsquo;s invovling the <em>class association</em> like <code>has_many</code>, <code>belongs_to</code> etc.</p>

<p> Exactly how&rsquo;s the <em>association</em> involved? SO has another great <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/783584/ruby-on-rails-how-do-i-use-the-active-record-build-method-in-a-belongs-to-rel">answer</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Towards understanding of the routes</h1>

<p>Let me layout the gist of routing:</p>

<h2>User browser side:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Request: <code>HTTP_METHOD</code> + <code>URL</code></li>
<li><code>HTTP_METHOD</code>: One  of <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, <code>PUT</code></li>
<li><code>URL</code>: Something like <code>/products/17</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>Server side:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Needs to decide: Controller, Action, and Params</li>
</ul>


<h2>Example:  <code>/products/17</code></h2>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;products&rdquo; :&ndash;> Controller</li>
<li>&ldquo;17&rdquo; :&ndash;> :id (of  Params)</li>
<li>Now what&rsquo;s the <em>Action</em> ? (Method to call)
Answer: Depends on <em>HTTP_METHOD</em> , which is not part of URL, but part of
the underlying communication from browser. ex. GET &ndash;> Show (Quite obvious)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Helpers:</h2>

<p>In Rails code, both <code>URL</code> and <code>HTTP_METHOD</code> for the generated link can be constructed
in some kind of wrapper method like <code>product_path(1)</code>. This is part of Rails <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1548009/rails-link-to-routes-and-nested-resources">evolution history</a>.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s troubling me is it&rsquo;s fair enough to understand the explict way of just write out the URL,
but sometimes confusing to figure out what exactly some helper would generate.</p>

<p>Take an example with:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='erb'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">button_to</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Add to Cart&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cart_items_path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">product_id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">product</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>button_to</code> has default http method of <code>POST</code>. We look up in the table from the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html">Rails guide</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post_method.png" alt="Resources Routing Table" /></p>

<p>Which is exactly it&rsquo;s supposed to do: create a new cart_item. The params are encoded in the URL:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Generated HTML Code</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">action=</span><span class="s">&quot;/cart_items?product_id=4&quot;</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;button_to&quot;</span> <span class="na">method=</span><span class="s">&quot;post&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Turns out the <em>view</em> alone is a totally new world. I guess this is
what they call a <em>front end</em> ? CSS is a language more or less similar
to XML, which is structured, nested, element/attribute oriented language.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s declarative. This makes a difference. Programming in declarative needs
an understanding of the <em>engine</em> that&rsquo;s behind the interpretation of such
rules. However, I don&rsquo;t have to step-by-step simulate a running program.
All I have to do, is just start with a blank paper, and <em>add</em> the <em>effects</em>
of those elements and attributes under the rules. The good thing about this
kind of system is it&rsquo;s constructed by superposition, like linear systems.
While imperative programming is more about states and transition in time,
the reasoning is harder and more delicate.</p>

<p>Learning CSS elements and properties certainly take time. However,
to have some sense of design and imagine a <em>target</em> to draw is a skill
of another level. Perhaps I should just be satisfied at the moment
for some basic tricks like positions, fonts, and just dividing the page
into some blocks of areas.</p>

automatically generate code which is a private method to <code>permit</code> the paramters of assignment.</p>

<p>After setting the <code>permit</code> method, things are working now.</p>

<p>Next I modified the view of the products index a bit with a bit of plain HTML table. It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; as Depot, but functional enough for me.</p>

<p>Then I want the home page to show the products index, modified the route and
it&rsquo;s a small change. At least now I know where to look for the changes when I want to do something.
The comments in those generated files are helpful.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;d like the <em>sidebar</em>, which I know got to do with <em>layout</em>. Then I faced the problem of writing
css, which I basically still knows nothing about. Refer to the scss of Depot, I found out about the
<code>float</code> attribute, which probably makes the left/right split to panes.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a great <a href="http://www.jaceju.net/blog/archives/18/">article</a> on this.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been observing Bitcoin and read about it for some time now.
I think I&rsquo;ll just give it some of my opinions.</p>

<p>Recently Bitcoin has risen from a niche toy ( when you could buy a pizza for 10,000 BTC ), to
the all time high of over 1000 USD per BTC. It entered pubic sight and caught the attention of
governments. There are many stories to tell, let me just layout the ones I think are significant
and worth some thinking:</p>

<ul>
<li>some consider BTC one of <a href="http://www.garynorth.com/public/11828.cfm">Ponzi scheme</a></li>
<li>there are BTC-backed organized crimial black market for drugs, guns etc.</li>
<li>BTC are used for cross-border money transfer with low transaction fees</li>
<li>BTC are used as marketing stunts ( some real estate even sold for BTC )</li>
<li>BTC has their own exchanges like a stock market</li>
<li>BTC are said to have risk of being used for money laundering</li>
<li>BTC heists. Virtually impossible to trace.</li>
<li>there is a whole small industry to <em>print</em> the money of BTC (mining hardware,software)</li>
<li>Finally, BTC are considered currency of the future</li>
</ul>


<p>Just 2 days ago, the central bank of China issued some <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/publish/goutongjiaoliu/524/2013/20131205153156832222251/20131205153156832222251_.html">notice</a> ( essentically government policies ) to
ban the use of BTC by any banks or financial instituations, or any commercial payments.
The price of BTC dropped significantly following the news.</p>

<p>My opinions can be expressed by my predictions of the future of Bitcoin:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin ( or its variant ) <em>will</em> survive, because it&rsquo;s a credit system that offers unique features:
anonymity. It&rsquo;s perfect for criminal activities and other secret merchant activities. For this single
reason, it can survive for as long as there&rsquo;s a demand for such a credit system. Sad, but unavoidable.</li>
<li>For BTC to have <em>value</em>, it has to be backed by <em>real money</em> that are exchangable to general society
economic merchandises. Currently it has been the BTC exchanges, which are filled with speculators.
What <em>I predict will</em> appear is something like a BTC bank, that an organization will <em>offcially back</em> the BTC similar to the repayability of dollar ( once in history USD are exchangable to gold ). Such bank, whether above ground or underground, will show up simply because it&rsquo;s profitable and sustainable from collecting transaction fees. Imagine such <em>bank</em> gurentees 1 USD to 1 BTC repayment at any time, if such bank can be trusted enough, BTC essentically become USD with added property of anomymity. By BTC&rsquo;s current limit of 21 million, this will be 21 million of this speical kind of USD.</li>
<li>Speculators could keep the price of BTC at high level, if they allow their money to be freezed in the form of BTC. However, the game will eventually become in equilibrium, the number of speculators and
speculator money will cease to increase, and some people inevitably would like to withdraw their money to do something else. The over-evaluation period will end, the price will drop to a level that is
suitable to the demand of the said above use: demand for anonymous money for dark activities.</li>
</ul>


<p>I could even provide a wild guess for the lower bound of BTC price. Since the dark market&rsquo;s global
scale is at least in the billions USD range. Let&rsquo;s give an absurd value of 1 Billion usage of BTC
as the means of trade. 1,000,000,000 / 21,000,000 = 47.6 USD.</p>

<p>Conclusion: BTC under 47.6$ will be a buy.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Don&rsquo;t take this seriously. Pure speculation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I spent some time watching an hour-long <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8&amp;feature=share">video</a> about <em>Functional Programming</em>.</p>

<p>It made two significant points that struck me:</p>

<ul>
<li>types are just mathematical sets</li>
<li>functions can be thought just like mathematical functions mapping set A to set B ( input type and return type )</li>
</ul>


<p>When thinking like this, I all of sudden get a hint of what a <em>type system</em> actually
might be like. Although this talk is primarily to layout the work for <em>monads</em>, it
really helps understanding programming from a different perspective than imperative.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about one input and one output, but multiple input can be tricked to use <em>currying</em>
to simulate ( or compose ). That has a lot of potential in reasoning about programs.</p>

<p>Other aspects regarding philosophy also are quite remarkable:</p>

<ul>
<li>The word <em>simple</em> is ambiguous. It can be &ldquo;more explict, more obvious&rdquo; by some, but
&ldquo;more implict, more abstract&rdquo; by others. The word <em>small</em> however, always implies <em>simple</em> but without
the controversy.</li>
<li><em>Composability</em> is <em>the</em> way to manage complexcity, or build one. This makes sense.
Random stiched up things are scary and unmaintable. In his words, we spent to much time not
productive, but just stiching tings up.</li>
</ul>
