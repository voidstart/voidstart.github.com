  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quite accidently, it&rsquo;s been 21 days and I finished first reading of the Agile Rails book.
Learn Rails in 21 days.. Well, not quite.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s usable and refreshing in many aspects, but far from masterery. If this were bicycle,
I&rsquo;d be just able to make one meter without putting foot on the ground. You know the
skills are just that many, but need more excercise to burn into the brain.</p>

<p>So far I can remeber to do scaffold generation and db:migrate, sometimes just not sure
when to use <code>rails</code> when to use <code>rake</code>. To add a new column, a new migration ( some kind of
script ) has to be written and run and tracked. In <code>def change</code>, the syntax for new column
is not obvious to the mind, had to look it up.</p>

<p>The devil&rsquo;s in the details. The plan is bascially correct.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought I&rsquo;d just start to warm up myself by writing some sorting
algorithm.</p>

<p>At first, I thought to first write some random generator for testing usage. Then
I realized that&rsquo;s not the goal, to compare each algo with different types of inputs.
I am just trying to implement <em>correct</em> sorting. The performance, code compactness,
caching all are not my concerns. So the result is hardcoded <em>random</em> input, and I
will print the whole array after each <em>pass</em> or interation (after swap etc), to
observe the <em>sorting process</em> and final sorted array.</p>

<p>I did from scatch the bubble, insertion, selection and merge sort. Turns out it&rsquo;s
not easy to get right the first try even for such simple algorithm. My errors mostly
on index off by 1, edge cases. Time spent mostly on thinking the <em>sorted</em> vs the <em>unsorted</em> part,
and their transition. Direction, index, temps are most concerned.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good excercise.</p>

<p>I review some other things besides this:</p>

<ul>
<li>the spiral rule of c++ declaraions</li>
<li>c++ quiz quesions (includes some c++ 11 stuff)</li>
<li>stack and queues</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>CreditCard Processor Gem (ActiveMerchant)</li>
<li>Haml ( Yet another compressed syntax like Sass )</li>
<li>More Plugins</li>
<li>Page 457/476 (96.0%) &ndash;> End of All Readings</li>
</ul>


<h1>&ldquo;Syntax Compression&rdquo;</h1>

<p>Replace a long &ldquo;class=..&rdquo; with &ldquo;.&rdquo; is clearly easier to type.
Less verbose, but semantically the same. What&rsquo;s changed is the
syntax, or could say <em>compressed</em>.</p>

<p>The more often used stuff are compressed to shorter things like just
a single char. It&rsquo;s mathematically obvious that encodings like this save
more space/typing.</p>

<p>Just like in algebra, complex variables are represented by just a Greek letter.
It makes writing, reading, reasoning all the easier.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s for humans, the hands and the brains.</p>

<h1>&ldquo;Funny names&rdquo;</h1>

<p>Cucumber, Rspec, webrat.. It&rsquo;s definitely just 0s and 1s and nothing special.
I think the <em>branding</em> is to create identity, to advertise, to make an impression,
to humans, ultimately.</p>

<p>Serves similar to <em>syntax compression</em>, it taps to how human brain works, related
to cognative science, neuro science and phycology. One of the ways for gamblers to
remember cards is to associate each card with a unique object like a flag, a tree etc.
It&rsquo;s the common memorization techniques.</p>

<p>We could go futher to create deeper associations. One example is, to remember several
random objects, one imagine a room he&rsquo;s in and <em>put</em> the random things to certain
locations in the room, as one <em>virtually</em> walking inside it. This creates connections
to things with one&rsquo;s sense of space ( room places ) and time ( walking ).</p>

<p>Maybe next time I&rsquo;ll name some Gem this way, when I write my own gems.</p>

<h1>&ldquo;Voila&rdquo;</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s the end of first time reading this book. A lot is learned, a lot is made sense of,
still a lot is missing the connection.</p>

<p>Next up, I&rsquo;ll try to redo the app on my own, <em>without</em> following the steps, to refresh the
memory and understanding.</p>

<ul>
<li>Migrations ( Table, Index, Keys )</li>
<li>Standalone scripts ( Extension to Ruby, use of Active Support )</li>
<li>Gem, Gemfile, Bundle</li>
<li>Rack</li>
<li>Page 441/476 (92.6%)</li>
</ul>


<h1>&ldquo;Value of the Standalone&rdquo;</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be wonderful if the table legs are not just for the table, but
can be useful as something else. It&rsquo;ll be wonderful if those legs
can be easily plug-out and put into another furniture as a useful component.
Rails&#8217; active support, active records are very useful to help build other things.</p>

<p>Standalone implies decoupling, compartmentalized, component-oriented.
It usually means there&rsquo;s less to worry about, and only one interaction is to be concerned.
The Rails Agile Book talks about <em>nonbrowser</em> application, sugguesting no browser is involved
in interaction. This makes several important components irrelevant (views, layouts), but the model
is still to be interacted with.</p>

<p>Scriptability is a sweet candy. It feels great to <em>tap</em> into the <em>runtime</em> of an app.
<code>rails console</code> is like a console from games such as Quake and Counter-Strike.
The console offers examination and modification at <em>runtime</em>. What&rsquo;s more, Rails offers
web-service like API that are scriptable (JSON, XML interfaces), with similar human experience to local
development. The book describes this similarity as <em>magic</em>.</p>

<p>Dependencies versioning. What Gemfile does is both simple and powerful. What make it look better than
other systems are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Semantic versioning</li>
<li>Uniformity</li>
</ul>


<p>Rack is like yet another proxy/agent/adapter/.. (whatever people feel like to call such things), but for
integration with web-servers.</p>

<h1>&ldquo;Cache and State&rdquo;</h1>

<p>Cache is in pinciple just a faster copy of something else.
Yet the simplicity of its surface does not warrant it&rsquo;s simple
underneath. Caching is one of <em>the</em> hard problems in many systems.</p>

<p>When create cache, immediately worry about several things:
capacity, synchronicity, invalidation. Worse, cache systems tend to
<em>cascade</em> from level to level. CPU&rsquo;s have severl levels of caching.</p>

<p>Be fast, but definitely don&rsquo;t be wrong.
Trade space for speed, without sacrificing correctness.</p>

<p>Think of it as two worlds: the cached world, the <em>real</em> world.
In short: Use the cached world when it&rsquo;s a correct mirror, when
it&rsquo;s not, mirror first. How does it become un-mirrored/out of sync?
Either <em>real</em> world updated, or the cached world breaks (dropped cache
or non-existent).</p>

<p>Thinking this way helps understanding the whole point of cache systems.</p>

<h1>&ldquo;Partials&rdquo;</h1>

<p>Classic divide and conquer. Big worlds versus nested smaller worlds.</p>

<p>What partials do are analogous to functions, just for views. <em>Context</em> is what is passed into
the smaller worlds. With the <em>context</em>, some actions are performed, to either
produce a side-effect (like IO) or just prepare some data (returned value like string,
objects)</p>

<h1>&ldquo;Migration&rdquo;</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s like Git log, but version controling the database.
 Keeping track of changes, that could be reverted.</p>

<h1>&ldquo;Semantic naming&rdquo;</h1>

<p>Normally in languages, names are just symbols, identifiers, nothing much than
some random letters.</p>

<p>Here we have Rails, names have meanings. <code>find()</code>, <code>find_by_xxx()</code>, <code>find_all_by_xxx()</code>,
esencially it&rsquo;s embedded APIs in namings. I am not sure this is like meta-programming such
as C++ macros, it&rsquo;s more powerful and natural.<br/>
I think it at least has two advantages :</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean syntax. Less clutter like brackets, easy to read.</li>
<li>Natrual feeling. Reads more like English.</li>
</ul>


<p>A good idea for language design.</p>

<h1>&ldquo;SQL injection&rdquo;</h1>

<p>A rather <em>old</em> topic, yet still very relevent.</p>

<p>On the surface, this is about escaping syntax tricks. What&rsquo;s more fundamental is, the question
of what is data and what is code. Code and Data are represented by the same 1 and 0&rsquo;s and transferred
all the same. The point of interpretation, or execution, is critical for avoiding unintended (or
ill-intended) treating data as code. This is the root of all priviledge stealing in systems by design.</p>

<p>Of course hackers can still hack accounts and passwords by brute-force guessing or social means. But treating
data as code is <em>the</em> technical vulnerability to fight in all sorts of systems, be it SQL, shell codes, overflows etc.
The idea is to let the machine <em>run MY code</em>.</p>

<h1>&ldquo;DRY: Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself&rdquo;</h1>

<p>In a sense, the database table/row/column has much resonance with
the OO&rsquo;s class/object/attribute. The dimensions are very similiar.</p>

<p>This is repitition to the humans.However, to the machines and the different
systems, it&rsquo;s more like saying more or less the same thing in two
langauges. Translation is in order. But since this is defined so
formally in computer languages, can&rsquo;t that be easily translated by
machines themselves?</p>

<p>Well, Active Record is all about the automatic translations. There
are rules about names translation, and operations translations, defined
by humans. Once the rules are in place, the human repetitions can stop.
Naming things is hard, except when you can fixiate on some convention
predefined. Everybody just have to agree on the conventions.</p>

<p>We are like dealing with very intricate stuff in a small kingdom of computer
models and objects and databases and what have you. We can&rsquo;t keep
debating about the names of common things like streets and roads. That
has to be fixed to let us communicate effectively, so we can navigate
without losing the way.</p>

<p>Rails is such fixation. We express one thing, Rails knows the other.
There are exceptions when we want to keep things <em>irregular</em>, Rails allows
that can let us put our exceptions in the system.</p>

<h1>&ldquo;Production&rdquo;</h1>

<p>Prototype and production are different. The gap may seem complex
but it really shouldn&rsquo;t be. The stuff makes a good prototype should
have good benefits on the production-type also. But then comes the
question of why the gap.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about <a href="http://voidstart.com/blog/2013/11/25/ror-day-11/">Production Qualified</a> before,
about the differences in existence. Now I wonder why one system cannot take the upsides of both.</p>

<p>There really is no reason that a prototype shouldn&rsquo;t be stable and performant. The real problem
is simplicity. Production systems are complex, especially for large scale. It takes extra logic
to optimize/enhance for different situations, such as millions of concurrent users or bad 3G network.
Security risks are high, storage loads are high and data is much more important that can never be
lost. Logging is going to handle both the load and safisticated enough for deep analysis, even
for graphing and data mining purposes.</p>

<p>Why cannot all these be some kind of plugins that could be easily enabled by installation with
a package manager. If the structure is well thought of to enable such reliable extension, there
really should be no reason of why it can&rsquo;t be done.</p>

<li>Practice the Playtime tasks</li>

</ul>


<h1>&ldquo;Playtime&rdquo;</h1>

<p>Following the book to write the app is straightforward, since everything
is detailed explained.</p>

<p>Playtime is the section without the answers explained, but only the questions given.
I had struggled with some of the questions for quite some time.</p>

<p>So far I have done all the playtime by myself and many of the errors I made are
caused by misunderstanding and carelessness. Through Googling and re-examining
the source codes, eventually the issue will settle.</p>

<p>The hard part about development is sometimes the error message just does not make
sense, you have to apply intuition, play and compare and ask good questions. This
is ultimately about the gap between computer and human, imagine if computer can
figure out all the underlying issues of why something does not work and print
the exact issue right in front of you. Everything is just like cooking recipe, even the error
printed, designed by human. The logic paths are thought first by a human, then coded
into recipes for the execution loop.</p>
